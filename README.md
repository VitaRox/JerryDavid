JerryDavid is the name of my forthcoming website, a comprehensive web-hosted relational database of information pertaining to the television show, "Seinfeld".  I might be interested on working on this with someone, if there are any other nerds who wanna spend their time developing a "website about nothing". ;)

The basic concept is to have a comprehensive database about the show "Seinfeld" which can be modified or queried by the lay user without having to know SQL or write queries or any of that. I want to use a simple, field-based entry system for the user to be able to query the underlying database using simple string searches entered in said fields.  Something like that.

I'm using MySQL Workbench to develop the underlying schema, HTML/CSS for the general page look, JavaScript to help display the information on the front-end, Node.js to communicate with the database back-end, and ultimately, Azure to deploy and maintain the site.  I may end up using React.js on some of the front-end stuff, too, as that is a technology I want to master and may find that it speeds up the front-end dev workflow considerably.
